# Rexbots
# Link Cache — once a URL has been downloaded and uploaded once, its
# Telegram file_id is remembered so the exact same link never has to be
# re-downloaded: it's re-sent straight from Telegram's own servers via
# send_cached_media(), which is near-instant regardless of file size.
#
# Only used for single-file downloads (one URL -> one file). Playlists,
# folders and anything split into multiple parts aren't cached, since
# there's no single file_id that represents the whole thing.
