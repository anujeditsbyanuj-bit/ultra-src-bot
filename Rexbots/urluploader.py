# Generic URL Uploader
# Ported from Url-uploader-Bot-V4 (Plugin/echo.py + Plugin/dl_button.py), rewritten
# to fit this bot's plugin style and reuse Rexbots/direct_utils.py.
#
# Every other downloader plugin in this bot (catbox, gofile, pixeldrain, mediafire,
# streamtape, terabox, mega, gdrive, ytdl's yt-dlp fallback, etc.) already claims
# its own domains. This plugin is the LAST-RESORT fallback: any bare http(s) link
# that isn't one of those known hosts, and that yt-dlp itself doesn't recognise as
# a media site, gets treated as a plain direct-download link — downloaded as-is
# and uploaded to Telegram. This is the one capability the original bot didn't
# have (it could only pull from Telegram channels / specific hosts, not from an
# arbitrary raw file URL).
